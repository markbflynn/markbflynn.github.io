## About Me

I’m a former Navy officer turned higher education professional. I studied history at William & Mary before earning an MBA from Lynchburg College and then joining the Navy. During my time in the Navy, I got to drive warships, work with incredible people from all over the country, and learn a lot about myself and how the military operates across air, sea, and undersea mission areas.

When I left the military, I spent a year consulting on anti-submarine warfare systems, then returned to grad school for a degree in Higher Education Administration. Currently, I work with computer science students at Virginia Tech as an academic advisor, helping them navigate college and plan for what’s next. I’m especially interested in veterans in higher education, the evolving relationship between education policy and government, and why the gender gap in education attainment keeps growing.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, learning to code, watching football, and cheering for the Washington Capitals.
