## About Me

I’m a former Navy officer turned higher education professional. I studied history at William & Mary before earning an MBA from Lynchburg College and then joining the Navy. During my time in the Navy, I got to drive warships, work with incredible people from all over the country, and learn a lot about myself and how the US Navy operates across air, sea, and undersea mission areas.

When I left the military, I spent a year consulting for the Department of Defense, then returned to grad school at UVA for a degree in Higher Education Administration. Currently, I work with computer science students at Virginia Tech as an academic advisor, helping them navigate college and plan for what’s next. I’m especially interested in researching the link between the widening gender gap in college completion, veterans’ pathways into higher education, and the national STEM shortage. 

In my free time, I enjoy photography, watching college football & the Washington Capitals, and riding my Peloton bike.
